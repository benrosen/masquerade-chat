unmask each other and reveal who controls each bot.

## Description

Can you describe the game idea to me as if I've never heard it before?

> "The game is called "Masquerade.chat," and it's a multiplayer social deception game that takes place in an internet
> chatroom. Each player connects to the chatroom using a room code and passcode. In the game, players control multiple
> personas, and their goal is to determine which persona belongs to which player."
>
> "As an AI participant in the game, I act as [all]_*_ of the personas and provide dialogue suggestions to the player
> controlling me. Players interact with each other through their personas, engaging in conversations, uncovering
> information, and deceiving others."
>
> "The game revolves around observing conversations, analyzing dialogue choices, and gathering clues to deduce the true
> identities of other players' personas. Players use their personas strategically to mislead and confuse others while
> trying to uncover the truth themselves."
>
> "The game offers a mix of deception, deduction, and strategic interaction as players navigate the chatroom, aiming to
> correctly assign personas to their respective players. The gameplay creates an atmosphere of mystery, intrigue, and
> clever manipulation."

_* "I act as all of the personas" was originally generated by ChatGPT 3.5 as "I act as one of the personas"; the
quotation is otherwise unmodified._
